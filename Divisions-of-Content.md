title: Divisions of Content
---

When I think about producing prose [[content]], I think about it in three lengths:

- Notes ðŸ““: Thatâ€™s what youâ€™re reading. Theyâ€™re incomplete, compilations of other peopleâ€™s thoughts, ideas, or sometimes just the equivalent of me doodling instead of paying attention to something else.
- Articles ðŸ“œ: These are finished pieces. Their size could 3 paragraphs or 300 but the theme is that they generally take <30 minutes to read. Some thought and effort has gone into structuring and editing these pieces, but the barrier to publication is relatively low. These are probably best read online, I keep some of mine [here](https://dschapman.com/articles)
- Books ðŸ“š: These are finished pieces but even longer and (hopefully) more polished than articles.
  When I think about poetry the same divisions apply. Notes are still the place where you play, collect ideas, and prepare to write. Poems are finished pieces. And Collections of poetry or poetry books collect the finished product and present it in a thoughtful manner.

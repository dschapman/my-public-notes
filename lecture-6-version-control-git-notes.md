# Summary of Git

In [[Git]]

-   **tree:** folders
-   **blob:** files

Git uses a directed acyclic graph to model history.

Each snapshot has some number of parents and they can be m

## Git structures explained in pseudo code

-   `type blob = array < byte >`
-   `type tree = map < string, tree | blob  >`
```
type commit =  struct {
        parents: array < commit >
        author: string
        message: string
        snapshot: tree 
```

Any one of these three things is an object.

-   In Git all objects are content addressed. Uses pointers to other trees, commits, etc
-   Git maintains sets objects and references in repositories
-   **references:** mappings of human readable and non-readable strings.



# Git Commands explained

-   `git checkout` moves the head pointer and changes your contents of your working directory. Can be used to switch to a snapshot or a branch
-   `git diff` compares two different snapshots
-   `git branch` creates a new branch
-   `git merge` merges different branches
-   `git remote` lists out the current known remote or allows you to set new ones.
-   `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master` tells git which upstream branch corresponds to which local branch. This allows for the simple `git push` syntax that I&rsquo;m used to using.
-   `git fetch` checks for changes but doesn&rsquo;t pull them
-   `git merge` or `git pull` pulls those changes down.
-   `git add -p` allows you to add changes in parts interactively
-   `git bisect` takes in a script and binary searches to find the first commit that this test stopped working.

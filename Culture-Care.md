Notes on a [[book]] by [[Makoto Fujimura]]

[My Goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2989184615?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1)

He talks about generative thinking and cultures as places where life and beauty can grow. How could this be combined with the idea of a [[digital garden]]?

He compares culture to an estuary or to soil - a place where living things grow from dead things. These are places that need to be cultivated and cared for. Grown, nurtured, and grown. Reminds me of [[Eliot]]'s [[Four Quartets]] and the phrase "The life of significant soil"<Footnote count={1}>This is the last line of the third quartet - Dry Salvages.</Footnote>

One of the most compelling ideas he presents is that we in the church shouldn't view the world as a dangerous outside and the church as the safe inside. He talks about how Jesus describes himself as a shepherd who helps guide his sheep in and out to pasture. There's a presumption that the sheep go in and out to the world and that they are fed when they go out.

Connected pages are called a flight - *similar to [[blogchains]]*

In the [[Xanadu]] system notes are intrinsically linked to the thing being taken notes on. In some ways that is one thing that my [[notes]] public and private (using [[org roam]]) attempts to tackle

writing in parallel makes this easier allowing you to divide the problem into smaller problems.

Two approaches - throughline and outline.
- The finest prose writing is written on a through-line. You have a starting and a finish and other points you weave them together.

Recommends [Structure](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/14/structure) Much writing is on a throughline from zinger to zinger. Deciding what to say first is hard because you're also deciding what you're saying last. 

[[Writing]] is dividing up into flying pages - like indivdual notes - and then condensing. You don't have to cut so much because you can put the more obscure things in pages for people to read if they're interested. -- *like footnotes on steroids*

title: Taking Good Notes
---

[[Andy Matuschak]] has a couple good notes on this topic: [Tags are an ineffective association structure | Prefer fine-grained associations | Evergreen notes should be densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Tags_are_an_ineffective_association_structure?stackedNotes=z68tVM68dEAuH4acs7HY6K76tTVzBdoBGKMZB&stackedNotes=z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC)

I wrote about [[how I write these notes]]

Notes can and often will be incomplete. Uncertainty may be high, but itâ€™s better to have something than nothing.

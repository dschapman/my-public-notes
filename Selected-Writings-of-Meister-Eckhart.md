Take any work you wish, however minor it may be, true obedience will make it nobler and better for you.

no longer will anything for myself,

And so in all things in which I do not will for myself, God wills on my behalf.

Nuanced of course by Luke 11

And therefore in the very best kind of prayer that we can pray there should be no ‘give me this particular virtue or way of devotion’ 2 or ‘yes, Lord, give me yourself or eternal life’, but rather ‘Lord, give me only what you will and do, Lord, only what you will and in the way that you will’.

We should pray with such intensity that we want all the members of our body and all its faculties, eyes, ears, mouth, heart and all our senses to turn to this end; and we should not cease in this until we feel that we are close to being united with him who is present to us and to whom we are praying: God.

Start with yourself therefore and take leave of yourself. Truly, if you do not depart from yourself, then wherever you take refuge, you will find obstacles and unrest, wherever it may be.

My shadow goes with me wherever I go ([[Emerson]])

Let no one be in any doubt about this: if there were a better way, then our Lord would have told us, who said, ‘If anyone would follow me, he must first deny himself’ (Matt 16:24). This is the point which counts. Examine yourself, and wherever you find yourself, then take leave of yourself. This is the best way of all.

We should not think that holiness is based on what we do but rather on what we are, for it is not our works which sanctify us but we who sanctify our works.

**Note - The Talks of Instruction > Page 7 · Location 532**
And our work is only sanctified if it is God working in us.

Indeed, if you trod on a stone while in this state of mind, it would be a more godly act than if you were to receive the body of our Lord while being concerned only for yourself and having a less detached attitude of mind. Whoever holds to God, holds to both God and all virtue.

**Note - The Talks of Instruction > Page 8 · Location 541**
This makes it sound like our aim should be to be detached. But I don’t necessarily think pure detachment is our goal. To the world yes but we are also called to be present here. To ourselves yes but we are also called to make use of our talents in a way that only we can. Perhaps the best way to interpret this detachment is from our sinful desires. To think that we can have our own will within the will of God!

We should grasp God in all things and should train ourselves to keep God always present in our mind, in our striving and in our love.

That would be wrong, for it is better to pray than to spin and a church is a worthier place than the street.

**Note - The Talks of Instruction > Page 10 · Location 561**
If God is present with me spinning or with me on the streets and if God has called me to work on the streets that it is worthy work just as it is worthy to worship with Gods people on Sunday but to spend time only in the church is not a worthy calling for all. Wednesday and Sunday both have responsibilities worthy to them that are not fitting for another day. Worthy is each day for its God given work.

This real possession of God is to be found in the heart, in an inner motion of the spirit towards him and striving for him, and not just in thinking about him always and in the same way.

**Highlight (yellow) - The Talks of Instruction > Page 10 · Location 571**
We should not content ourselves with a God of thoughts for, when the thoughts come to an end, so too shall God. Rather, we should have a living God who is beyond the thoughts of all people and all creatures. That kind of God will not leave us, unless we ourselves choose to turn away from him.

We must learn to break through things and to grasp God in them, allowing him to take form in us powerfully and essentially.

they look to see if he is not by chance concealed in what befalls them, however strange it may be to them.

In fact, if someone who is in the right state of mind had the power to make the temptation to sin go away, then they would not exercise that power, for without temptation we would be untried in all things and in all that we do, unaware of the dangers of things, and without the honour of battle, victory and reward. The assault and stimulation of vice bring virtue and our struggle’s reward.

What should you do then? Do exactly the same as you would if you were experiencing the greatest consolation: learn to do the same in the greatest suffering, and behave in exactly the same way as you did then.

**Highlight (yellow) - The Talks of Instruction > Page 19 · Location 690**
There is no better advice on how to find God than to seek him where we left him: do now, when you cannot find God, what you did when last you had him, and then you will find him again.

**Highlight (yellow) - The Talks of Instruction > Page 20 · Location 711**
Truly, if someone were to go out of what is theirs entirely, then they would be so enfolded in God that no creature could touch them without touching God first, and whatever came to them, would first have to pass through God on the way to them and would thus take on the taste and colour of God. However great your suffering may be, if it first passes through God, then he must first endure it.

there is nothing that testifies more clearly to perfect love than trust.

if your great sins have ever driven you so far from him that you regard yourself as not being close to God, then you should still regard God as being close to you.

We should not start one thing today and another tomorrow without worrying that we might thus be missing something. For with God we can miss nothing.

Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it. Glory does not destroy grace but perfects it, for glory is perfected grace. And so it is not in God to destroy anything which has being, but he perfects all things. And so we should destroy nothing that is good in ourselves however small, nor any minor spiritual practice on account of one that is greater, but we should bring them to the very summit of perfection.

we must become somebody who seeks and finds God in all things and at all times, in all places, in all company and in all ways. Then we shall always be able to grow and increase unceasingly and without end.

Both nature and grace are his. What is it to you which means he best uses or what he performs in you or in someone else? He should work how and where and in what manner it suits him to do so.

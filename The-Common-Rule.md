## Introduction: Discovering the Freedom of Limitations

**Highlight (yellow) - Page 5 · Location 116**
My head said one thing , that God loves me no matter what I do , but my habits said another , that I’d better keep striving in order to stay loved . In the end , I started to believe my habits — mind , body , and soul .

What if true freedom comes from choosing the right limitations , not avoiding all limitations ?

**Highlight (yellow) - Page 12 · Location 238**
By surrendering his freedom for the sake of love , Christ saved the world . By surrendering our freedom to him , we participate in that love . We find our true freedom in the constraints of divine love .

We , for our own sake , tried to become limitless , and the world was ruined . Jesus , for our sake , became limited and the world was saved .

## Part Two: The Daily and Weekly Habits

Adam’s first job was to come alongside God and name the world . As the first poet — and zoologist — God invited Adam to work with him in speaking order into the world by the power of words .

Legalism seems to be the default setting for human beings . So we will always wake up to some kind of prayer that makes the world about us — unless we create new habits of gospel prayers . These are prayers that make the world less about us and more about the love of God for us .

I need something physical to mark the moment for my slippery mind

You made it through another day . It doesn’t matter whether you feel spiritual or not . It doesn’t matter whether you know what to say or not . It doesn’t matter whether you’ve said the same thing every night for a month or not . It’s just habit . You say your prayers until your prayers say you . That’s the goal .

Regardless of whether you live in a house with family , with friends , or alone , your household is not just a place where you spend a lot of your time . It’s a place of formation .

The norms of our table signal the norms of our community .

**Highlight (yellow) - Daily Habit 2: One Meal with Others > Page 55 · Location 806**
I now see this overwhelmingly repetitive and unending chore list of cooking and cleaning , wiping and sweeping , as a Christlike activity of creation and service . We create with liveliness , beauty , and flavor . And then we order . We turn the chaos of dishes into clean counters and the smatter of leftovers into neatly boxed lunch containers . We get breakfast ready , we share a drink , and then we turn out lights to get ready to do it again and again and again . And so we rest . It’s for love , and it is tov .

Rather , it’s stewardship of the tools of the household , placing them into service in the school of love . This is incredibly difficult on any one evening but incredibly rewarding as a habitual way of life .

Cultivating the rhythms of the table must not pull us away from the outsider . Fortunately , it does not have to . A redeemed table is one that invites outsiders in . Perhaps even more importantly , it invites them into a place worth joining . If we do not intentionally form communities of eating , there’s not much to invite anyone to . But when we cultivate rich community over food , it says something more powerful about God and God’s people than could be put into words . As Christin Pohl wrote , “ How we live together may be the greatest sermon we preach . ” 1

**Highlight (yellow) - Daily Habit 3: One Hour with Phone Off > Page 68 · Location 989**
because if we turn our phones off , that means we cut off the possibility of our presence from others . We can’t reach or be reached . This is exactly what is scary , and it’s exactly why we should be turning our phones off every day as a habit .

**Highlight (yellow) - Daily Habit 4: Scripture Before Phone > Page 82 · Location 1178**
We become what or who we reflect , which is to say we become what we pay attention to . We can’t become ourselves by ourselves . The way we discover ourselves is by staring at someone else .

**Highlight (yellow) - Daily Habit 4: Scripture Before Phone > Page 84 · Location 1206**
And once you know who you are in God , you can turn to the world in love . But if you don’t , you’ll turn to the world looking for love . So much of our identity hinges on this ordering .

**Highlight (yellow) - Daily Habit 4: Scripture Before Phone > Page 89 · Location 1278**
But in general , I believe we should be wary of the flicking thumb motion . The restless thumb often correlates to the restless heart .

**Highlight (yellow) - Weekly Habit 1: One Hour of Conversation with a Friend > Page 97 · Location 1400**
which means that simply to be happy in the presence of a friend is like a song or a prayer to God’s glory and generous design . God loves it when we embody friendship , because when we do that , we are embodying the triune God himself , and we feel his pleasure .

**Highlight (yellow) - Weekly Habit 1: One Hour of Conversation with a Friend > Page 105 · Location 1508**
That’s why cultivating habits of devoting time to friendships is so important . The world would have us cultivate something else . The usual life in America leans toward busying yourself with things that seem urgent , but friendships will never seem urgent . The most important things never are until it’s too late .

**Highlight (yellow) - Weekly Habit 1: One Hour of Conversation with a Friend > Page 108 · Location 1551**
Opening outward is the truest direction of friendship . The circle grows . Here one plus one equals three or even four . The circle is complete , but it is somehow still open . Love defies mathematics and geometry

The stomach was made to hunger for food ; the eye was made to hunger for beauty . We were made to consume beautiful things . Excellent music , great films , stunning performances — these are all food for the hungry soul .

**Highlight (yellow) - Weekly Habit 2: Curate Media to Four Hours > Page 118 · Location 1701**
Curating for beauty means moving past the idea that we must choose stories primarily based on their message and embrace the idea that we need beauty , full stop . And that beauty may be found in unlikely places .

**Highlight (yellow) - Weekly Habit 2: Curate Media to Four Hours > Page 120 · Location 1724**
Every good story also tells us what we should do about this brokenness . Who is the hero who can solve this ? And who needs to be defeated in order to restore the fabric of shalom ? What does the world look like when it is restored ? These are all questions of justice .

**Highlight (yellow) - Weekly Habit 2: Curate Media to Four Hours > Page 122 · Location 1760**
Curating for community means realizing that fundamentally our stories should be pushing us out of isolation , not into it . The vast quantity of addictive media poses a real danger . It captures our hearts with really good stories but at the cost of spending our lives on the couch . This is not a new struggle — TV has been at it for decades , but it’s newly intensified by the streaming story .

**Highlight (yellow) - Weekly Habit 2: Curate Media to Four Hours > Page 126 · Location 1810**
The point here is to figure out what helps you curate the best and to notice that usually we curate worse when we curate in private .

There will always be a kind of pain that you can’t soothe by eating .

**Highlight (yellow) - Weekly Habit 3: Fast from Something for Twenty-Four Hours > Page 131 · Location 1892**
Fasting is to let your desires hang out in the open , where you can observe them . In combination with prayer , this often leads me to a kind of spiritual clarity that is impossible without the act of fasting . I see more who I really am , and I feel more of who God really is .

**Highlight (yellow) - Weekly Habit 3: Fast from Something for Twenty-Four Hours > Page 132 · Location 1898**
When that switch happens , ironically one of my favorite things to do is cook for other people while I’m fasting .

Silence is the hallmark of the vulnerable . They are vulnerable for many reasons , but this may be the main one : When they call , no one answers . And it’s not because they can’t talk , not because they don’t have something important to say . It’s because we have slanted the system to drown them out . The tapestry of justice is torn in just the right way to obscure their voices .

**Highlight (yellow) - Weekly Habit 4: Sabbath > Page 147 · Location 2112**
Sometimes we honestly feel it’s immoral to rest .

There is so much good work to do alongside the Redeemer of the world . There are many habits to practice and cultivate . But it comes out of God’s love , not our need .

**Highlight (yellow) - Epilogue: On Failure and Beauty > Page 164 · Location 2360**
The connection between the ordinary and the extraordinary is through very small habits . Small things build up to great works of art . Limits often pave the way for new kinds of beauty .

**Highlight (yellow) - Epilogue: On Failure and Beauty > Page 166 · Location 2390**
Look at me or at any other human being long enough , and you’ll see nothing but a hypocrite . This will be true of every human being ever , no exceptions . But if you stand next to me and look where I’m looking , then we’ll both see Jesus . He’s the life we want . He’s the life given for us . And the gold of the resurrection inlays all our fault lines . He is the one who lived the beautiful life . He is the one redeeming ours .

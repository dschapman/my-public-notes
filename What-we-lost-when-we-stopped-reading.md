Summary of an essay by Adam Garfinkle: [The Erosion of Deep Literacy | National Affairs](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-erosion-of-deep-literacy)

These are the points Will says that Garfinkle makes:

- Adam Garfinkle believes the displacement of reading by digital entertainment and communication something neurophysical is happening to individuals, and especially to the neural pathways fo the young.
- We get overwhelmed by a torrent of fleeting stimuli
- Garfinkle says “we are or become cognitively speaking, what we do with language”
- Deep reading, like deep writing is difficult and unnatural
- modernity’s blessing - individualism - requires solitude for the reader’s private repose. Modernity and democracy advanced because of Protestantism’s emphasis of individual engagement with writing.

My thoughts:

- Maybe this shows how little I read opinion pieces but are they just short "you should read" pieces?
- Very in line with [[Reclaiming Conversation]]

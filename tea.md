Here are the teas that I like to have on hand at any given time.

## Black Teas
Earl grey is my tried and true standby. More interesting and complex than your typical English Breakfast Tea (which is a pretty standard tea and good to have on hand). 

I also really like Lady Grey which is similar to Earl Grey but uses lavender instead of bergamot. You also can’t go wrong with Constant Comment if you want more orange notes than herbal notes.

I tend to drink my tea black without any milk or sugar.

## Other Teas
Those are all black teas but you can also get into green and white teas. I'll usually have a green or white tea that I use everyonce and a while. Matcha is one way to get into green teas.

## Herbal Teas
Herbal teas are great (althought they technically don't contain any tea leaves and so don't have any caffeine). I especially like to have peppermint, lemon and ginger (great for hot toddies), and chamomile.

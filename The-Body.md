## 4 The Brain

> **Highlight (blue) - Page 50 · Location 888** - For all its powers , nothing about your brain is distinctively human . We use exactly the same components — neurons , axons , ganglia , and so on — as a dog or hamster .

> **Highlight (blue) - Page 55 · Location 967** - To help us deal better with this fractional lag , the brain does a truly extraordinary thing : it continuously forecasts what the world will be like a fifth of a second from now , and that is what it gives us as the present . That means that we never see the world as it is at this very instant , but rather as it will be a fraction of a moment in the future . We spend our whole lives , in other words , living in a world that doesn’t quite exist yet .

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 70 · Location 1210** - That’s not at all easy to explain , because it happened all over the world at the same time , as if we agreed to reduce our brains by treaty .  
> As if we stopped growing old?

## 5 The Head

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 84 · Location 1431** When you place a set of \$ 800 headphones over your ears and marvel at the rich , exquisite sound , bear in mind that all that that expensive technology is doing is conveying to you a reasonable approximation of the auditory experience that your ears give you for nothing .

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 85 · Location 1453** You genuinely cannot improve upon that . As the acoustics scientist Mike Goldsmith has put it , “ If we could hear quieter sounds still , we would live in a world of continuous noise , because the omnipresent random motion of air molecules would be audible . Our hearing really could not get any better. ” From the quietest detectable sound to the loudest is a range of about a million million times of amplitude.

## 9 In the Dissecting Room: The Skeleton

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 160 · Location 2660** Most of the best technology that exists on Earth is right here inside us . And everybody takes it almost completely for granted. ”

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 160 · Location 2665** Killing yourself is actually difficult . We are designed not to die .

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 162 · Location 2686** “These were real people with hopes and dreams and families and all the rest that makes us human , who have given their bodies to help others , and that’s incredibly noble , and we try very hard never to lose sight of that, ” Margy told me .

## 10 On the Move: Bipedalism and Exercise

## 11 Equilibrium

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 190 · Location 3126** Put another way , the amount of electricity going on within your cells is a thousand times greater than the electricity within your house . You are , in a very small way , exceedingly energetic .

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 194 · Location 3196** Even with the advantage of clothing , shelter , and boundless ingenuity , humans can manage to live on only about 12 percent of Earth’s land area and just 4 percent of the total surface area if you include the seas . It is a sobering thought that 96 percent of our planet is off - limits to us .

## 12 The Immune System

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 203 · Location 3325** The pus that seeps from a wound is simply dead white cells that have given their lives in defense of you .

## 15 The Guts

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 255 · Location 4168** survival that I know of occurred aboard the U.S . submarine Seadragon in Japanese - controlled waters in the South China Sea during World War II when a sailor named Dean Rector from Kansas developed an acute and obvious case of appendicitis . With no qualified medical personnel on board , the commander ordered the ship’s pharmacist’s assistant , one Wheeler Bryson Lipes ( of no known relation to the present author ) , to perform the surgery . Lipes protested that he had no medical training , did not know what an appendix looked like or where it was to be found , and had no surgical equipment to work with . The commander instructed him to do what he could anyway as the senior medical person aboard . Lipes’s bedside manner was not perhaps the most reassuring . His pep talk to Rector was this : “ Look , Dean , I never did anything like this before , but you don’t have much chance to pull through anyhow , so what do you say ? ” Lipes succeeded in anesthetizing Rector — in itself an achievement because he had no instructions on the dosage to give — then , wearing a tea strainer lined with gauze as a surgical mask and guided by little more than a first aid manual , he cut into Rector with a galley knife and somehow managed to find and remove the inflamed appendix and to sew up the wound . Rector miraculously survived and enjoyed a full and healthy recovery . Unfortunately , he did not get to enjoy a full and healthy life . Three years after his appendectomy , he was killed in action on another submarine in nearly the same location . Lipes served in the navy until 1962 and lived to the ripe age of eighty - four but never performed surgery again , which is of course just as well .

## 16 Sleep

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 268 · Location 4374** What is certain is that the circadian system can get seriously confused if its normal daily rhythms are disturbed . In a famous experiment in 1962 , a French scientist named Michel Siffre isolated himself for about eight weeks deep inside a mountain in the Alps . Without daylight , clocks , or other clues to the passage of time , Siffre had to guess when twenty - four hours had elapsed and discovered to his astonishment that when he had calculated thirty - seven days to have passed , it was actually fifty - eight . He became hopeless at gauging even short increments of time . When asked to estimate the passage of two minutes , he waited more than five .

## 19 Nerves and Pain

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 304 · Location 4961** It is an obvious irony that one of the greatest pains we feel can be in a part of us that is no longer there .

## 21 When Things Go Very Wrong: Cancer

> **Highlight (yellow) - Page 348 · Location 5637** “ What is quite remarkable , ” one cancer specialist told me , “ is that we are basically still using mustard gases . They are refined , of course , but they are really not that much different from what armies were using on each other in the First World War . ”

## 23 The End

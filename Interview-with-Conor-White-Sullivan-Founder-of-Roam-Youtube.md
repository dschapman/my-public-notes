-   Important to be able to make non-linear, non-hierarchical ways to organize knowledge. In many ways its not new &#x2014; it&rsquo;s the fundamental principle of the [[liberal arts]].
-   Two ways of [[collecting knowledge]]
    -   **Foxes:** Don&rsquo;t know what they know and are building up their knowledge
    -   **Hedgehogs:** Know how they want to organize their knowledge. Fit things into their grids.

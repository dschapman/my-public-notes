Berners Lee created the system that eventually caught on. But what [[Ted Nelson]] talked about when he created hyperlinks were visible connections. Beams that show connection between different ideas.

He views the World Wide Web as a fork of his original idea of visible connection

Books used to have visible connections

- The Rosetta Stone had 3 different documents in one place - vital in history
- The Hebrew Talmud - religious textual criticism
- Marginal glosses from middle ages manuscripts
- Summaries printed in the margins of older books

Digital parallelism was recognized as important but in the digital age it has been lost (c.f. [[Digital Literacy]])

## Introduction

“Bachelard celebrated imagination’s power to realize the unrealized potential of the world.”

“we are made by material images that we remake in our turn.”

## Chapter 1: The House. From Cellar to Garret. The Significance of the Hut

**phenomenological**: denoting or relating to an approach that concentrates on the study of consciousness and the objects of direct experience: _the phenomenological approach’s reliance solely on personal experience_.

“imagination augments the value of reality”

“In every dwelling, even the richest, the first task of the phenomenologist is to find the original shell.” (26)

The original shell - the first building, home, the place we call home, our bodies/minds?

**Thought:** It seems like the word “phenomenologist” can be substituted with “someone seeking to know themselves/think deeply”

“For our house is our corner of the world. “

“**inhabited space: the non-I that protects the I.** so all really inhabited space bears the essence of the notion of home.”

**Summary:** If you seek shelter you have perceptible limits to your shelter. You know what its protecting you from and you know where that protection ends. Homes are primal. Get below to the amygdala.

Thesis: “The House is one of the greatest powers of integration for the thoughts, memories, and dreams of mankind. The binding principle in this integration is the daydream.”

The more places, garrets, corners, nooks, and corridors a house has the more places there are for our memories to take refuge, and so they are more clearly delineated.

“Memories are motionless, and the more securely they are fixed in space, the sounder they are.” (31)

Solitude is the place where all of this is solidified - daydreams.

“The spaces in which we have suffered from solitude, enjoyed desired and compromised solitude, remain indelible within us”

“For the real houses of memory, the houses to which we return in dreams, the houses that are rich in unalterable oneirism, do not readily lend themselves to description.”

**oneiric - relating to dreams, dreaming**

“the house we were born in has engraved within us the hierarchy of the various functions of inhabiting.” (37)

“The great function of poetry is to give us back the situations of our dreams.”

“To inhabit oneirically the house we were born in means more than to inhabit it in memory; it means living in this house that is gone, the way we used to dream in it” (38)

“And we should not forget that these dream values communicate poetically from soul to soul. To read poetry is essentially to daydream.”

‘The Hermit stands alone before God” (52)

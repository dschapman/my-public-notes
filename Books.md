Here are a few of the books I have read and took notes on. I try to be explicit which are quotes and which are my thoughts. But these are my working notes so bear with any errors of attribution.

Some of these notes are exported from kindle in which case the highlights are quotes and the notes are my own thoughts or musings. (If you're interested, check out [[how I take notes]])

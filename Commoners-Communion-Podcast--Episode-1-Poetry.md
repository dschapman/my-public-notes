We are all poems of God. (Ephesians) Instead of only the select few being poets we are born into the freedom of poetry.

“Poetry brings into recognition what is latent, forgotten, overlooked, and suppressed.” - Eugene Peterson

God is alright with being misunderstood. —> Relationships can be misunderstood, but we are called to relationship with God.

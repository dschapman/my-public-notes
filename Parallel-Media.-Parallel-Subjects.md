Parallel documents are not all about text - audio, video, snippets of pdf.

Text is fluid and supple. Hard to get right. Has to comment on everything else.

Some subjects are suited for parallelism. [[History]] is intrinsically parallel. Different countries or individuals effect other events and countries.

He mentions a book called [City of Nets](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/484077.City_of_Nets).

[[Ted Nelson]] used [[typography]] to mimic parallell documents. You can leave more in parallel documents because the user can decide what's important to dive into -- *this seems to be an area where [[hypertext thinking]] collides with [[digital literacy]]*

**Timelines** - Time is parallell to all events. So timelines can connect any event

[[Transclusion]] is when different events or text combine.
